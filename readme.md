# Endless Runner
To implement Python programming in a real application!

## What Did I Learn
- The Event Loop: Checks player input (or checks timers) so we can update the image on the screen in response
- Pygame: Draws images, plays sounds, checks for input (without pausing the entire code to do so!), and also has useful tooks for things like timers, collisions, and displaying text
- Surfaces: the *display durface* is the game window and is unique and always visible; other *surfaces* are images placed on the display surface, flexible in number and only shown when on the display surface
- Blit: Block Image Transfer (used in screen.blit)
- Text: Create a font, place text on a surface, blit the surface onto the screen
