# Endless Runner
To implement Python programming in a real application!

## What Did I Learn
- The Event Loop: Checks player input (or checks timers) so we can update the image on the screen in response
- Pygame draws images, plays sounds, checks for input (without pausing the entire code to do so!), and also has useful tooks for things like timers, collisions, and displaying text
